# Placeholder for Jupiter Rings Texture

This file needs to be replaced with the actual Jupiter rings texture image. 

## How to Replace

1. Download the Jupiter rings texture from one of these sources:
   - NASA: https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a000000/a004800/a004851/jupiter_rings.png
   - Alternative: https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/download/2k_jupiter_ring_alpha.png

2. Save the file as `jupiter-rings.png` in this directory.

3. If neither source works, you can:
   - Create a simple ring texture in an image editor like GIMP or Photoshop
   - Use a transparent PNG with a subtle white/dusty gradient from inner to outer edge
   - Make sure the image has an alpha channel for transparency
