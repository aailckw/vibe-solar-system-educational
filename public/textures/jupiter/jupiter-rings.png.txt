This is a placeholder text file for jupiter-rings.png.

In a real implementation, this would be an actual PNG image with:
- Transparency (alpha channel)
- A thin, faint ring pattern
- Subtle dusty appearance 
- Proper inner and outer edges

Please replace this file with a proper PNG image as described in the JUPITER_RING_TEXTURE_SETUP.md document.
