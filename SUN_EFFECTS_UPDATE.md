# Sun Effects Update

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Expanding Circle Effect
- Removed the `SunCorona` component which was creating the expanding circle effect
- This effect was causing performance issues and visual distraction

### 2. Enhanced Core Sun Material
- Increased emissive intensity from 2.5 to 3.0 for a brighter Sun
- Enhanced the pulsing animation with more dynamic variations
- Improved color shifting for a more realistic appearance

### 3. Enhanced Sun Glow Effect
- Increased opacity from 0.3 to 0.4 for better visibility
- Enhanced the pulsing animation with multiple frequencies
- Improved color variations for a more dynamic appearance

### 4. Adjusted Scene Lighting
- Reduced ambient light intensity from 0.3 to 0.2
- Increased point light intensities (12 and 8) for better Sun illumination
- Increased directional light intensity from 2.5 to 3.0
- Increased hemisphere light intensity from 0.5 to 0.6

## Components Affected

1. **SunEffects.tsx** - Removed SunCorona component
2. **PlanetMaterials.tsx** - Enhanced SunMaterial and SunGlow components
3. **SolarSystemSimulation.tsx** - Adjusted lighting parameters

## Visual Improvements

- The Sun now appears brighter and more radiant without the distracting expanding circle effect
- The core pulsing animation is more dynamic and realistic
- The overall scene lighting better highlights the Sun
- Performance has been improved by removing the expanding circle effect

## Technical Details

- The Sun's glow effect still provides a soft, radiant appearance
- Solar flares and lens flare effects remain unchanged
- All changes maintain scientific accuracy while improving visual appeal
- The implementation uses efficient frame-based animations to minimize performance impact
