# Sun Effects Radius Reduction by 10x

This document confirms that all Sun effect radii have been reduced by 10x as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Solar Flares (SunEffects.tsx)
- Original radius: `size * 0.5`
- Updated radius: `size * 0.05` (10x reduction)

### 2. Sun Lens Flare (SunEffects.tsx)
- Original radius: `size * 4.0`
- Updated radius: `size * 0.4` (10x reduction)

### 3. Sun Glow (PlanetMaterials.tsx)
- Original radius: `size * 1.8`
- Updated radius: `size * 0.18` (10x reduction)

## Implementation Details

All radius values were divided by 10 to achieve the requested reduction. This makes the Sun effects more subtle and realistic while maintaining their visual impact.

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/solar-system/SunEffects.tsx`
2. `src/components/solar-system/PlanetMaterials.tsx`

## Verification

The changes have been implemented and verified. The Sun now has a much more subtle glow and effects that are appropriate for the scale of the simulation.
