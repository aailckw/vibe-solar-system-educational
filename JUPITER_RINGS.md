# Jupiter Ring Implementation

This document describes the implementation of Jupiter's ring system in our solar system simulation.

## Scientific Background

Jupiter's rings were first discovered by the Voyager 1 spacecraft in 1979. Unlike Saturn's bright, prominent rings, Jupiter's rings are faint and composed primarily of dust particles. The ring system has several components:

1. **Main Ring**: The brightest part, extending from approximately 122,500 km to 129,000 km from Jupiter's center.
2. **Halo Ring**: A thicker, fainter region interior to the Main Ring.
3. **Gossamer Rings**: Two very faint outer rings associated with the moons Amalthea and Thebe.

The rings are composed primarily of dust particles ejected from the moons due to micrometeorite impacts.

## Implementation Details

Our implementation includes these scientifically accurate characteristics:

1. **Size and Scale**:
   - Inner radius: 1.4x Jupiter's radius
   - Outer radius: 1.8x Jupiter's radius

2. **Appearance**:
   - Very faint opacity (0.25)
   - Dusty brown-gray color (#8A7F66) as fallback
   - Thin profile aligned with Jupiter's equator
   - Higher resolution (128 segments) to capture detail

3. **Rotation**:
   - Aligned with Jupiter's equatorial plane (3.13Â° axial tilt)
   - Proper orbital mechanics for ring particles

## Texture

The ring texture is stored at: `/textures/jupiter/jupiter-rings.png`

If the texture fails to load, the system will fall back to a scientifically accurate color representation.

## Technical Notes

- The ring uses `depthWrite: false` for proper transparency handling
- The material uses high roughness and zero metalness for realistic dust appearance
- The ring geometry uses 128 segments for smooth rendering
