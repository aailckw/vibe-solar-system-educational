# Vercel Deployment Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes made to ensure the Solar System Education project builds successfully for Vercel deployment.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. TypeScript Type Errors
Several components were referencing the `THREE` namespace directly without proper imports, causing build failures:

**Files Fixed:**
- `src/components/solar-system/AstronomicalBackground.tsx`
- `src/components/solar-system/CosmicBackground.tsx`
- `src/components/solar-system/NASAStarField.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Replaced `useRef<THREE.Mesh>(null)` with `useRef<Mesh>(null)`
- Replaced `useRef<THREE.Points>(null)` with `useRef<Points>(null)`
- Added proper imports for `Mesh` and `Points` from 'three'

### 2. Deprecated Three.js API
The `sRGBEncoding` constant was removed in newer versions of Three.js but was still being imported.

**File Fixed:**
- `src/components/solar-system/CosmicBackground.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Removed import of `sRGBEncoding` from 'three'
- Removed usage of `milkyWayTexture.encoding = sRGBEncoding` since modern Three.js handles this automatically

## Verification

The project now builds successfully with `npm run build` and is ready for Vercel deployment.

## Required Assets

The following assets are used by the application:
- Planetary textures in `public/textures/` directory
- Background images in `public/textures/backgrounds/` directory
- Jupiter texture in `public/textures/jupiter/` directory

Note: Jupiter ring texture (`jupiter-rings.png`) is referenced but may need to be downloaded separately for full functionality.

## Vercel Deployment Settings

For optimal Vercel deployment, ensure the following settings:
- Framework: Next.js
- Build Command: `npm run build`
- Output Directory: `.next`
- Install Command: `npm install`

The project should now deploy successfully to Vercel without any build errors.
