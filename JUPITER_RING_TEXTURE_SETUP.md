# Jupiter Ring Texture Setup Guide

This guide explains how to obtain and set up the Jupiter ring texture for the solar system simulation.

## Current Status

The Jupiter ring texture is referenced in the application but may not be present in your local installation. The system includes graceful fallbacks that will work even without the texture, but for the most realistic visualization, you should download the official NASA Jupiter ring texture.

## Option 1: Automated Download (Recommended)

The project includes a script to automatically download all required NASA textures:

```bash
node download-textures.js
```

This script will download the Jupiter rings texture from NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio and place it in the correct location.

## Option 2: Manual Download

If you prefer to download the texture manually:

1. Visit the NASA Scientific Visualization Studio page for Jupiter rings:
   https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4851

2. Download the Jupiter rings texture:
   - Direct link: https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a000000/a004800/a004851/jupiter_rings.png

3. Save the file as `jupiter-rings.png` in the following directory:
   ```
   public/textures/jupiter/
   ```

## Option 3: PowerShell Download Script

You can also use the included PowerShell script:

```powershell
.\auto-download-nasa-images.ps1
```

## Verification

After downloading the texture, you can verify it's working by:

1. Running the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigating to the Jupiter visualization in your browser
3. Checking the browser console for messages about Jupiter ring texture loading

## Fallback Behavior

If the texture is not found, the system will:
- Display a console message indicating the texture is missing
- Use a scientifically accurate color representation of Jupiter's rings
- Maintain all other ring functionality (size, position, animation)

## Texture Details

The Jupiter ring texture is a scientifically accurate representation showing:
- The main ring
- The halo ring (closest to Jupiter)
- The gossamer rings (faint outer rings)
- Proper coloration based on Jupiter's ring composition

The texture is provided by NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio and is in the public domain.
